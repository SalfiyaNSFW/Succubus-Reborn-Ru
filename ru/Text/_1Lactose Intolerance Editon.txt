//Lactose Intolerance Edition
//So, the way the translator works, when it detects Japanese characters, it sweeps this folder for a replacement and... well, replaces it.
//The funny thing is, it reads the whole file, which means in the events of duplicates, it'll load the last one in alphabetical order, and will ignore anything that doesn't match.
//So! If you want to ditch my personal edits and have a 'true' translation, remove the '_' from the beginning of this file, and the game will load it over all affected entries
//You will have to either restart the game or hit Alt+R for these replacement to take effect, however.
//Use your imagination to figure out which is which... Or select the untranslated line and Ctrl+F it in the deck edit file, that works too.
//I still could make a picture set for these, TBH... Even if I'm unsure if I have enough wolves to go around.
//Still, if you care enough to run the original translations, you'd probably prefer the original artwork, so that's still up for request.
